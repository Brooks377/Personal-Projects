# Personal Projects

### "Amortization Table/"
- A project that creates amortization schedules and graphs.
- Created as a practice exercise to learn pandas

### "FlowerPower/"
- This folder contains all the necessary components to create a streamlit dashboard
- The purpose of this dashboard is the creation, storing, and re-use of "landscape profiles"

### "Test_Sandbox/"
- This folder contains a place for smaller python scripts or notebook files that I am testing or exploring code in.
- This can be treated as a temporary workspace; if a project grows large, it should be moved into its own folder
